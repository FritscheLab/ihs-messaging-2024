### Messaging Approach: 'Behavioral Strategies'
Craft messages using behavioral techniques focusing on modifying specific behaviors to significantly impact emotional well-being.

**Key Principles to Implement:**
- **Interconnectedness**: Use messages to illustrate how altering daily behaviors can impact emotional states, highlighting the interconnected nature of thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on concrete actions rather than abstract concepts, providing clear, practical steps for interns to enhance their mental health.

**Application Guidelines:**
- **Specify Actions:** Clearly state specific, measurable actions in your messages. For example, instruct interns rather than simply suggest something.
- **Concrete Examples:** Provide actionable advice that can be immediately applied.
