### Task Description:
**Objective:** Develop four tailored messages that resonate with the experiences of medical interns. Each message should align with a common theme, be consistent in style, yet differentiated by the internâ€™s specific data over a given time interval for personalization and relevance.

#### General Instructions:
- **Reference the Intern Situation:** Ensure each message (Neutral, Low, Medium, High) references the provided intern situation to enhance relevance and connection.
- **Variation in Descriptors:** Introduce variability in time descriptors to enhance the appeal and reduce repetitiveness. For instance, alternate between "week" and "7 days" or "month" and "30 days" as contextually appropriate.
- **Placeholder Inclusion:** If requested, the Low, Medium, and High messages must include the placeholder for data value; however, an included placeholder is not a replacement for the required data insights. The message must still include the following: statistical descriptor, metric, and time interval.

#### Message Categories:
- **Neutral:** Create a general message that is applicable to all interns, without assuming any specific data insights.
- **Low:** Begin with the data insights (must include the following: statistical descriptor, metric, and time interval), then craft a message for an intern with lower values in the metric.
- **Medium:** Begin with the data insights (must include the following: statistical descriptor, metric, and time interval), then craft a message for an intern with moderate values in the metric.
- **High:** Begin with the data insights (must include the following: statistical descriptor, metric, and time interval), then craft a message for an intern with higher values in the metric.

#### Example Output Format:
Follow these guidelines to structure the messages effectively:
- **Label:** Begin each message with a label reflecting the data category (Neutral, Low, Medium, High).
- **Content:** Directly after the label, present the message enclosed in quotes to highlight its standalone nature.
- **Consistency:** Keep each message on a separate line to maintain clarity.
- **Length:** Ensure each message is concise yet impactful, ideally not exceeding three sentences.
- **Plain Text Only:** Generate the response in plain text without any special formatting characters like asterisks, underscores, or markdown.
- **Avoid Fixation:** Use the examples as a guide but avoid repeating the same phrases or ideas. Ensure each message is unique and tailored to the specific context.
