### Messaging Approach: 'Motivational Interviewing'
Motivational Interviewing focuses on the individual’s autonomy, emphasizing that they know themselves best and have the ability to make their own choices. This approach is non-directive and aims to evoke personal motivations and goals.

**Key Principles:**  
- **Autonomy:** Respects the individual’s right to make their own choices, ensuring messages are supportive rather than directive.
- **Goal Evocation:** Utilizes open-ended questions to help individuals articulate their goals, linking desired changes to their personal values and objectives.
- **Self-Efficacy Support:** Enhances self-belief by highlighting past successes and providing encouragement.
- **Empathetic Engagement:** Acknowledges the difficulties of change, offering understanding and emotional support.

**Application Guidelines:**  
- Craft messages that reinforce the individual's control over their decisions.
- Encourage interns to reflect on how their daily choices align with their long-term personal and professional goals, fostering a deeper connection between current actions and future aspirations.
